Renamed in October 1982 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the death of Jeremy Bentham who is recognised as the spiritual founder of University College London. The myth that he was the founder is sustained in a bizarre manner by the college.  His 'Auto-Icon' as he called it, is in fact his skeleton, dressed in his own clothes and topped with a wax model of his head.  His actual head is mummified and kept in the college vaults. It is brought out for meetings of the college council and he is recorded as being present but not voting.
